## Description

This console application is a simple ATM simulator. Each time the application is run the user starts out with $10000.00 in their ATM account. The user is then presented with four options: to view the current balance, deposit money into it, withdraw money from it, or exit the ATM. Deposits and withdrawals cannot be negative and the withdrawal amount cannot supercede the amount remaining in the account.
